  "Classname": "func_conveyor",
  "Description": "The func_conveyor entity is a visible and by default also solid entity used to represent conveyor bands in appearance and function, but can also be used for different purposes, e.g. a water-stream/river. The yaw of the angles-keyvalue specifies the direction of texture moving. Any textures with names beginning with \"SCROLL\" (case-insensitive) will then scroll into that direction. However, notice that any texture rotation and mirroring will also affect its scroll-direction; not the push-direction, though. Scaling a texture on a face will also affect its scroll-speed - not the push-speed - in dependence on the scale-axis' relations to the relative scroll- direction.",
