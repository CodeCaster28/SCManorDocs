Player won't stop using the ladder unless jumping off or moving away from the ladder's surface sideways. Ladders on ceilings works as well. Sloped ladders produce unsatisfactory results and should not be used. Touching a ladder while falling will nullify the player's velocity and safe him from falling damage. Usually used in combination with a [func_illusionary](../func_illusionary) with ladder-textures for the visual counterpart.",
