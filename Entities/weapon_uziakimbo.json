      "keyDescription": "Set name of {{ entname }} so other entities can trigger it. Only 'On' and 'Toggle' trigger use-types are accepted which makes weapon be picked up by player '!activator'. Kill-targeting this entity will remove {{ entname }} and stop it from respawning.",

  "Notes": [
    "As all weapon-, ammo- and item- entities, this respawns after 15 seconds.",
    "If \"TOUCH only\" and \"USE only\" flags are selected, the weapon can only be collected by trigger. When those flags are not selected, the weapon also can be collected by trigger, but only if player is the !activator."

  "Issues": [
    "If you throw away one of your two uzis and recollect it, you will have both clips refilled without the cost of backpack ammunition."
