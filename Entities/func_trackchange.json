{
  "Classname": "func_trackchange",
  "Description": "Brush entity that works as a rotating ascending/descending elevator for func_tracktrain. It connects two path_tracks- elevator takes the train from last path_track of the top path, rotating and descending, and then, after finishing, the train is assigned to path_track of the bottom path. This can be reverted for ascending platform. The func_trackchange platform need origin brush (preferably located at the center of entity), and the top and the bottom path_corners should be centered to this entity for best results. See the picture on the left- the platform with origin brush tied to it (func_trackchange), and orange cubes that represents the top and the bottom path_track. Similar variant to this entity is [func_trackautochange](../func_trackautochange), however you can't trigger func_trackautochange in other way than by path_track's \"Fire on dead end\" value, you would trigger connected train instead.",

      "keyName": "targetname",
      "keyDescription": "Set name of {{ entname }} so other entities can trigger it to move platform up and down. If tracktrain is on platform it will travel with it as well. Every trigger use-type works uniformly. Can be kill-targeted.",

      "keyName": "_minlight",
      "keyDescription": "Sets the minimum light level. Set this value if entity is too dark on compiled map. Also useful for things like computer screens or holograms. Default is 0, max 1.",

    "Remember to create origin brush for this entity around which func_trackautochange rotates."
