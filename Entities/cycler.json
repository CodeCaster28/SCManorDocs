  "Description": "The cycler entity is used to display models in your map. Its collision hull is solid to bullets and will spill black and white blood. The cycler entity will cycle through the model's animations every time it takes damage, of in case it gets triggered- cycle part of current animation. A better, non-solid alternative to this entity is [item_generic](../item_generic], which allows you to set up your own collisions using clip- or null-textured brushes.",

Tip: If you have a window separating a dark and a bright room using only one entity, you can apply a brighter glass texture to the side of the window seen from within the dark room than to the side seen from the bright room. That way, the window's brightness will look realistic from both sides, instead of from just one. Generally, darker rooms require the render amount to be lower, making the glass more transparent, or it would look illogically bright."
