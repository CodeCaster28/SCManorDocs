  "KeyDescriptions": [
    {
      "keyName": "targetname",
      "keyDescription": "Set name of {{ entname }} so other entities can trigger it to start shooting gibs. Every trigger use-type works uniformly. Can't be triggered when gibs shooting is in progress. Can be kill-targeted but gibs stay.",

  "Notes": [
    "If your delay between shots is 0, the game may increase it notably; 0.01 works, though.",
