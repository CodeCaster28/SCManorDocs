  "Classname": "trigger_script",
  "Description": "This powerful entity allows you to put scripts made with AngelScript language on your map. Before Sven Co-op 5.0 you already were able to create almost anything with existed entities- this entity pushes imagination barrier even further allowing you to open an existing script and use functions. For more information on how to build trigger_script functions, visit the [SC AngelScript documentation](https://github.com/baso88/SC_AngelScript/wiki/trigger_script).",

  "Notes": [
    "A think mode trigger_script obeys usetype: triggering with \"Off\" will stop the trigger_script entity running, similarly \"Toggle\" will allow to switch between running and not running.",
    "When triggered, trigger_script will always trigger its target even if the script function fails to execute, such as the function not being found or a runtime error stopping execution of the function.",
    "If the loaded script contains a compile error, other map scripts will fail to load as well since a compile error halts the entire map script compilation process."
