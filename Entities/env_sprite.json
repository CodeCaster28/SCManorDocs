  "Notes": [
    "To make sprite work properly use \"Render Mode\" with optional \"FX Amount\". Most sprites can make use of 'Glow' or 'Additive' render modes (most sprites are in 'additive' format), however sprites with 'alphatest' works best with 'Texture' mode (background gets removed, image is opaque), while 'indexalpha' sprites are rendered properly only in 'Solid' and 'Texture', in any other mode they appearance is invalid. You can use third party tools like Sprite Explorer to check format of sprite if you are not sure, or check this Sprite List to check format type each sprite.",
    "Sprite alignment can also be set through the sprite itself. To do this, edit byte at offset 8 (meaning the 9th byte) in the sprite file using a HEX editor: 00: Sprite fixed on vertical axis- SPR_VP_PARALLEL_UPRIGHT; 01: Not supported- SPR_FACING_UPRIGHT; 02: Normal behaviour, sprite always faces you- SPR_VP_PARALLEL; 03: Sprite is fixed in space and can be rotated using angles- SPR_ORIENTED; 04: As SPR_VP_PARALLEL, but sprite can be rotated relatively to perspective using angles- SPR_VP_PARALLEL_ORIENTED.",
    "Oriented mode sprites tend to have problems with angle co-ordinates in hammer so its best to set them manually starting from [180,180,180] instead of [0,0,0]. In addition don't use negative numbers; instead subtract from 360. Also use 360 instead of 0 and carefully watch the use of hammer transforms as it will likely give you numbers that might look fine in hammer but will not work in-game. If you are still having troubles with angles not appearing in map I have an example RMF included in the example file download at the bottom (called \"oriented_angles.rmf\"). Taken from: [http://www.the303.org/tutorials/gold_sprite.htm](http://www.the303.org/tutorials/gold_sprite.htm)."

  "Issues": [
    "There is no key as of yet to set the initial frame of the env_sprite for it to draw. This must be done manually by changing the env_sprite's \"frame\" key via [trigger_changevalue](../trigger_changevalue)."
