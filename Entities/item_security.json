  "Description": "This works exactly the same way as [item_generic](../item_generic) does, except that this entity will automatically remove itself from the game when touched, so it allows to create custom collectibles by specifying custom model name.",
  "KeyDescriptions": [
    {
      "keyName": "targetname",
      "keyDescription": "Set name of {{ entname }} so other entities can trigger it. Only 'On' and 'Toggle' trigger use-types are accepted which makes item be picked up by player '!activator'. Kill-targeting this entity will remove {{ entname }} and stop it from respawning.",
      "keyChoices": []
    },

      "keyName": "target",

  "Notes": [
    "As all weapon-, ammo- and item- entities, this respawns after 15 seconds.",
    "If \"Touch only\" and \"Use only\" flags are selected, the item can only be collected by trigger. When those flags are not selected, item also can be collected by trigger, but only if player is the !activator."
