{
  "Classname": "func_trackautochange",
  "Description": "Brush entity that works as a rotating ascending/descending elevator for uncontrollable func_tracktrain. It connects two path_tracks- elevator takes the train from last path_track of the top path, rotating and descending, and then, after finishing, the train is assigned to path_track of the bottom path. This can be reverted for ascending platform. The func_trackautochange platform need origin brush (preferably located at the center of entity), and the top and the bottom path_corners should be centered to this entity for best results. See the picture on the left- the platform with origin brush tied to it (func_trackautochange), and orange cubes that represents the top and the bottom path_track. Similar variant to this entity is [func_trackchange](../func_trackchange) which reacts on all triggering inputs so you can move this platform by triggering it, instead of triggering connected train.",

Depending on trigger use-type: 'On'- stop train movement on path after track travel, 'Off'- start train movement on path after track travel, 'Toggle'- toggle train movement on path after track travel. Can be kill-targeted but track train won't travel any further if it's on {{ entname }}.",
