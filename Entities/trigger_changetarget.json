  "Description": "The proper method for changing the target-keyvalue of an entity. You should prefer this to using a trigger_changevalue, if you can, because this entity takes several special cases into account.",
  "KeyDescriptions": [
    {
      "keyName": "target",
      "keyDescription": "Entity which \"Target\" value will be changed.",
      "keyChoices": []
    },
    {
      "keyName": "targetname",
      "keyDescription": "Set name of {{ entname }} so other entities can trigger it to apply target change. Every trigger use-type works uniformly. Can be kill-targeted.",

  "Issues": [
    "This entity only changes one entityâ€™s target, likely the first entity that it can find, instead of applying the change to all entity instances whose name matches the target. [trigger_changevalue](../trigger_changevalue) can be used to get around this."
