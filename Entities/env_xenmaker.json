    "When using an env_xenmaker as an effect-template for squadmakers, you may have to ensure its position in the entity list to be after its according squadmaker(s) in order to avoid a crash on map-load. To achieve that, follow these steps: Select all env_xenmakers in your map and group them. Perform a copy-paste-special or clone-drag (hold shift), leaving the copy in the exact same position as its original. Hide the copy. Delete the original group. Unhide the copy and ungroup it. Save your map.",
