  "Description": "This is a logic entity which will trigger its target after being triggered a specified amount of times. Toggle-trigger and on-trigger will cause it to count up by 1. Off-trigger will cause it to count down by 1. An equivalent of this entity can be created through the usage of [trigger_condition](../trigger_condition) and [trigger_changevalue](../trigger_condition).",
