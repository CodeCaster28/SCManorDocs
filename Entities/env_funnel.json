  "Classname": "env_funnel",
  "Description": "When triggered, this creates a large portal funnel particle effect of green particles being sucked into one point as can be seen in Half-Life's single player mode in the Black Mesa experiment accident scene. This creates many temporary entities and the entity is removed after use. The particles will appear in a large area above the env_funnel and be sucked into it. You can adjust the effect's rotation by changing the env_funnel's angles. This effect is purely visual.",
