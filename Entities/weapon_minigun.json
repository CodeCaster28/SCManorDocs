  "Classname": "weapon_minigun",
  "Description": "The minigun consumes ammunition directly. Uses [ammo_556](../ammo_556)/[ammo_556clip](../ammo_556clip). Primary fire winds up the minigun barrel and starts fire shortly after. Secondary fire only winds it up. It is a heavy weapon which reduces the carrying player's speed and disables his ability to jump. It will only be picked up when the player issues his 'Use'-command on it. While holding the weapon, no other weapon can be selected. The minigun has to be dropped first. CVars:<ul><li>sk_556_bullet# (Default: 15, 15, 25): Minigun damage per bullet.</li></ul>",
